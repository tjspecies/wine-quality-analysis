# wine-quality-analysis
This project analyzes the Wine Quality dataset to explore patterns, visualize distributions, and build predictive models for wine quality. It demonstrates essential data analysis, visualization, and machine learning skills.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on wine characteristics
Visualize relationships between chemical properties and quality
Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict wine quality
Provide insights into which features most influence wine ratings

# Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control & portfolio
